A fun game for all the family members (from 13 up to 99) and from 1 to 99 players! (maybe)

## APP DESCRIPTION

This app is a game based on the acclamated boardgame from Blue Cocker Games and published on 2018 Welcome to... which is holding a 7.7/10 punctuation on the popular site BoardGameGeek with over 5.9K ratings.

BREADING SEASON will take you to the South Pole to help Penguins with it's breeding rituals.

For generations the male penguin has been gifting rocks to the females to build a nice nest on hopes to fu... have children with her. Nowadays things are not that easy, with their overpopulation (because you, human, has emended your ways and the globar warming has been corrected) the females are more picky than ever. 

You should help your male penguins to match with one female that only will be happy if she got more rocks than the ones on her right side.

Each round you will have to pick one penguin to help and use (or not) the useful resource associated to him.

There are 5 different resources that can be carried by the selected penguin:

- A lovely HEART that will make an establish couple to have an egg on their nest. (up to 4 eggs x nests) You will receive points depending on how nest of each value you will have at the end of the game (a nest can have 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 eggs and its value can be increased by another resource.)

- Half bottle of SUPER GLUE Do you really need all these rocks? Maybe 1 less could be better! It will let you reduce the penguin rocks amount by one.

- An oxidated PICK Are you sure all these rocks are enough? 1 more could be the solution! Split one of your rocks to get a new one! It let you increase the amount of the penguin rocks by one.

-Can you see the hole in the back of the female? Wouldn't it be nice if you would have a FISHING ROD? Then you are lucky! If the penguin related to this resource goes to live with a female penguin which has one of them they will be able to it more fish! (For you that means more points!)

- Any egg needs care and specialized nest. For that you get the nest upgrader! You can adapt a nest better for its amount of eggs. That means that if you want to get more only childs you can upgrade the 1 egg type nests to make it more confortable for them (Again, it means more points for you at the end of the game!)

- With overpopulation penguins are being a nice prey for the bad Leopard seals but, DO NOT WORRY! The good SEALS will help them! Choose this resource to improve your Security LvL! (As usual, more points at the end of the game!)
